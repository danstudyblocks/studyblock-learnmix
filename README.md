### requirements
- **postgres database** (Automatic setup when using the Railway template)
- **redis** (Automatic setup when using the Railway template) - fallback to simulated redis.

### commands

`cd backend/`
`npm run ib` or `pnpm ib` will initialize the backend by running migrations and seed the database with required system data.
`npm run dev` or `pnpm dev` will start the backend (and admin dashboard frontend on `localhost:9000/app`) in development mode.
`pnpm build && pnpm start` will compile the project and run from compiled source. This can be useful for reproducing issues on your cloud instance.
